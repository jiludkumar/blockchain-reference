##	Public Key Cryptography

It refers to any system that uses key pairs and, is also called asymmetric key cryptography.
There are two keys involved: 
* public key, known to every one and  
* private key only known to the owner.  

In this system, any person can encrypt a message using the receiver’s public key, 
but the message can be decrypted only by the receiver’s private key.
Due to the complex nature of asymmetric encryption, it is usually used only to transfer small bytes of data, 
like a symmetric encryption key. This key may then be used to encrypt the rest of the message.
